Play video on Dreambox for Android
***********************************

This app adds an entry to the android browser's share menu.
It sends the URL to a configurable
`playVideoOnDreambox proxy`__ server, which instructs your Dreambox to play
the video.

With this, you can browse youtube or other video sites and play the videos on your
satellite receiver.
